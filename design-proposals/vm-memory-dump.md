# Overview
Proposal for taking VM memory dump for analysis purposes.

## Motivation
One of the methods of troubleshooting guest virtual machines is getting a memory dump and analyzing it. As this is a standard capability in most VM management systems, it is also required for kubevirtâ€™s VMs.

## Goals
Have a mechanism to get a VM memory dump.

## Non Goals
Memory dump is not a restorable output and currently will not be a part of the VM snapshot.

## User Stories
As a Kubevirt user I would like to get a memory dump of a running VM so that I can later inspect its memory.

## Repos
[KubeVirt](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt)

# Design
To trigger a memory dump a virtctl memoryDump command will be added.
The command will either use an existing PVC or create a new PVC on demand. This PVC will be bounded to the VM and will appear in the VM volumes spec with a fiting status.
During the memory dump process this PVC will be mounted to the virt-launcher pod. After the mounting the guest memory will be dumped to that pvc and eventually it will be unmounted from the virt launcher.
The PVC will remain bounded - in the VM spec. It is the users' responsibility to export/use the memory dump results before reusing the PVC for a new memory dump. As long as the PVC is bounded as a memory dump "container" each memory dump command will overwrite the previous content.
It will be possible to track the last memory dump in the VM status with a new memory dump status that will be added there.
It will be possible to unbound the PVC and then do a memory dump to another PVC that will be bounded instead. 

## API

### Get memory dump
#### trigger memory dump
Run a virtctl command to get a memory dump. This new API will look as follows:

`$ virtctl memory-dump my-vm --volume-name=memory-pvc`

In this case `memory-pvc` should already exist and be of a size big enough to contain the memory dump. A check will be made to make sure.
It will be possible to ask for a PVC to be created with `--create` flag. In such case the required size will be calculated.

##### The process
The trigger of memory dump will call a VM subresource that will add a memorydumpRequest to the VM status.
The request will cause the binding of the PVC to the vm (if the pvc is not bounded yet) after that the pvc will be mounted to the virt-launcher that will trigger the guest memory dump `virDomainCoreDump` command with `VIR_DUMP_MEMORY_ONLY` flag to be executed by virt-launcher.
(Check out [virDomainCoreDump](https://libvirt.org/html/libvirt-libvirt-domain.html#virDomainCoreDump) for reference)
After the dump is complete it will unmount the pvc from virt-launcher.
The PVC will remain bounded to the VM - will be kept in the VM volumes and have an updated status and timestamp in the VM status.

#### remove memory dump from VM
Run a virtctl command to remove a memory dump from a VM. This new API will look as follows:

`$ virtctl remove-memory-dump my-vm`

##### The process
The trigger of remove memory dump will call a VM subresource that will add a removeMemorydumpRequest to the VM status.
The request will unbound the PVC from the vm. The PVC will be deleted from the VM spec and the memoryDumpStatus will be removed.

### Handle the memory dump
After the memory dump is completed the user will be able to export this PVC and also if there is a snapshot supported storage class the PVC can be a part of the VM snapshot and then it can be unbounded and deleted.
The output of the memory dump can be used for memory analysis with different tools for example [Volatility3](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3) and maybe also [sleuthkit](https://www.sleuthkit.org/autopsy/)


## Update/Rollback Compatibility
New API should not affect updates / rollbacks.

# Implementation Phases
The implementation wil be split to several phases:
* Add memory dump command in virt launcher server
* Add virtctl command to execute memory-dump with existing pvc
* Extend the virtctl command to support on-demand creation of PVC
* Add remove memory dump virtctl command
* Support block pvc for the dump (?)
